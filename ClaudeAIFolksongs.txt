Prompt: Write me a folksong where the singer is describing what it was like to be above ground for the first time.

Song One:

Singer’s First Glimpse of the Overworld

Oh the sun, it shone so bright 
Casting warmth and golden light 
As I stepped outside and felt the air 
After living underground, unaware

The endless blue up above 
Stretching on, as free as love 
Clouds like fluffy sheep did roam 
Across the sky, their wandering home

Green grass and trees, flowers bloomed 
Sights and smells my heart consumed
With wonder at this world so vast 
That I had never known till now, at last

The wind, it tugged my hair 
As if to say "you're welcome here" 
I heard birds singing, flapping wings 
More lovely than imagined things

So much beauty to behold 
More than I had e'er been told 
Of the wondrous world above 
That I'm blessed now here to love

I know I'll never take for granted 
The sky so blue and vast I've landed 
Underneath its peaceful gaze 
And bask in its sunlit rays

This place I'll cherish and defend
For this gift, I can't comprehend 
The joy that stirs within my soul 
Now free in the open air, no longer holed

Song Two:

The Sun on My Skin

Oh the sun on my skin, it feels so warm 
Like a comfort I've never known 
The breeze through my hair, so gentle and light 
How I dreamed of this world up above

The grass and the trees, they dance in the wind 
And the flowers, they bloom all around 
Such color and life, it takes my breath away 
So much beauty I've finally found

The clouds in the sky, they roll by so free 
And the birds singing their songs so clear 
A world full of wonder, how can it be real? 
My heart swells, for my dreams now are here

For so long I was trapped underground 
Never knowing the sun or the rain 
But no more darkness will keep me bound 
I'm alive, I'm awake, I'm free again!

Oh the sun on my skin, I'm alive, I'm awake 
The world is more than I'd dreamed it could be 
All that I missed, now at last I can take 
Every sight, every sound, every new memory

Song Three:

Singer’s First Glimpse of the Overworld

Oh the sun, it shines so bright 
Casting warmth and golden light 
Trees so tall, they touch the sky
Clouds drift by as birds fly high

I spent my days underground 
Never seeing, never found
 The beauty of the world above 
Skies so blue, filled with love

But today I saw the light 
Stepped outside and took first flight 
Felt the breeze dance through my hair 
Took a breath of fresh, clean air

Oh what wonders there can be 
When you're finally able to see 
All the beauty that surrounds 
Joyous freedom I have found!

No more darkness, no more fright 
Just this glorious sun-filled light
I'll never take for granted again 
The beauty found beyond my den

For the first time I understand 
The beauty of this lovely land 
And I hope I never will forget 
The day I first saw sunlight yet!
