Write a song about a socially awkward platypus in a folksong style

Verse 1:
He wanders alone in the wood
With his bill and his feet all good
But when it comes to social scene
He's the platypus you've never seen

Chorus:
Oh, the platypus, the platypus
So awkward, shy, and full of fuss
He wants to make friends, but it's tough
For this little fellow, it's just too much

Verse 2:
He's got a smile that's hard to find
And a laugh that's hard to mind
He's always searching for a way
To make friends and brighten up his day

Chorus:
Oh, the platypus, the platypus
So awkward, shy, and full of fuss
He wants to make friends, but it's tough
For this little fellow, it's just too much

Verse 3:
But don't you worry, don't you fret
This little platypus isn't done yet
He'll find his place in this big old world
With his quirk and his venom unfurled

Chorus:
Oh, the platypus, the platypus
So awkward, shy, and full of fuss
He wants to make friends, but it's tough
For this little fellow, it's just too much

Outro:
So if you see a platypus alone
Don't be shy, give him a bone
Because this little fellow needs a friend
Just like all of us in the end.
