Write a song about a socially awkward platypus in a folksong style

Verse 1:
He's a creature strange and rare
With a bill and a duck's rear
He's got webbed feet and a beaver's tail
But he's not quite sure how to prevail

Chorus:
Oh, the platypus, the platypus
He's a bit of an awkward fuss
He's trying to fit in but it's hard
Being a platypus in the yard

Verse 2:
He's got venom in his heels
But he's too shy to make a big deal
He's got fur but it's not too thick
So he's always feeling a bit sick

Chorus:
Oh, the platypus, the platypus
He's a bit of an awkward fuss
He's trying to fit in but it's hard
Being a platypus in the yard

Verse 3:
He's got big dreams, but he's not sure
How to make them happen, that's for sure
But he's got a heart full of hope
And he'll find his way, to help him cope

Chorus:
Oh, the platypus, the platypus
He's a bit of an awkward fuss
He's trying to fit in but it's hard
Being a platypus in the yard

Outro:
So let's raise a glass to the platypus
Let's show him that he's not so fuss
He's got a place in this world too
Let's give a cheer for the awkward platypus!
