Write a song about a socially awkward platypus in a folksong style

Verse 1:
With his bill and webbed feet,
He's a curious creature you'd meet
But when it comes to socializing
He's always left surprised and surprised

Chorus:
Oh, the platypus, the platypus
He's the shy one among us
He's searching for a friend
But the journey never seems to end

Verse 2:
He's got a smile that's hard to find
And a laugh that's hard to mind
He's always looking for a way
To break out of his shell and sway

Chorus:
Oh, the platypus, the platypus
He's the shy one among us
He's searching for a friend
But the journey never seems to end

Verse 3:
But he won't give up, he'll never tire
He'll keep on swimming like a mire
Because he knows that in the end
Friendship is a treasure to defend.

Chorus:
Oh, the platypus, the platypus
He's the shy one among us
He's searching for a friend
But the journey never seems to end

Outro:
So if you spot a platypus alone
Don't be shy and make him known
because this little fellow needs a friend
And friendship knows no end.
